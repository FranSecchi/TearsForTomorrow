# TecnoJam: a 1 month GameJam by TecnoCampus

This is a narrative game made by me and 4 colleagues for a "Slow" Jam organized by our college, TecnoCampus.

For this project, as the main developer I focused on the multiple choice dialogue system using Scriptable Objects in Unity.

I was also in charge of the character's movement and other simple functionalities, like buttons or doors.

Besides, though we decided it was not needed for a GameJam, I made a simple localization system to translate the game to other languages.
We did not write the translation of the dialogues nor the multiple texts, but I used the opportunity to implement and learn localization, using excel to write the diferent translations.
